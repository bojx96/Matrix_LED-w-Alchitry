2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net max/spi/max7219_clock_OBUF is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin max/spi/max7219_clock_OBUF_inst_i_1/O, cell max/spi/max7219_clock_OBUF_inst_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT max/spi/max7219_clock_OBUF_inst_i_1 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[0], max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[1],
max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[2], max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[3],
max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[4], max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[5],
max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[6], max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[7]
Related violations: <none>
