INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 2 threads
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net max/spi/max7219_clock_OBUF is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin max/spi/max7219_clock_OBUF_inst_i_1/O, cell max/spi/max7219_clock_OBUF_inst_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT max/spi/max7219_clock_OBUF_inst_i_1 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[0], max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[1], max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[2], max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[3], max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[4], max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[5], max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[6], and max/count/M_ctr_q_reg[7]
